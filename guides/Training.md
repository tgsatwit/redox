Below is a high-level plan that integrates your existing AWS-based codebase (as seen in your .env.local file) with new features for automatic document classification, enhanced data element detection, and redaction. This plan assumes you already have a Next.js app with AWS credentials and S3 configuration set up.

1. Architectural Overview
	•	AWS Services:
	•	Amazon S3: Storage for uploaded documents and redacted outputs.
	•	Amazon Textract: Extract text and data element bounding boxes from documents and return these calues to the application for multiple use cases.
	•	Amazon Comprehend (Custom Classification): Automatically classify document types.
	•	DynamoDB: Store document types, workflows and instrucitons, classification results, confidence scores, and user feedback.
	•	Application Layers:
	•	Frontend (Next.js): Document upload UI, manual classification prompts, redaction preview, and feedback collection.
	•	Backend (API Routes/Serverless Functions): Handle AWS API calls, process feedback, trigger workflow steps, and orchestrate updates.

2. Automatic Document Classification & Feedback Loop

Training & Initial Classification
	•	Custom Classifier Setup:
	•	Train an Amazon Comprehend custom classifier using labeled examples for your document types (ID, Invoice, Receipt, Australian Tax Notice of Assessment, etc.).
	•	Store training data in S3 and manage classifier endpoints.
	•	Workflow Integration:
	1.	Document Upload: User uploads a document via the Next.js interface.
	2.	Initial Classification:
	•	Call the Comprehend classifier from a API route.
	•	Evaluate the classifier’s confidence score.
	3.	Decision Branch:
	•	High Confidence: Automatically assign the document type and proceed.
	•	Low Confidence: Prompt the user with a manual selection option.
	•	Feedback Loop:
	•	Save manual selections and corrections in DynamoDB (or another database).
	•	Periodically retrain the classifier with new examples from user feedback using an active learning workflow. Use Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) to manage human-in-the-loop reviews and integrate them into the training pipelineclassifications.
	•	Optionally, use Amazon Augmented AI (A2I) to streamline human-in-the-loop reviews.

3. Enhanced Data Element Detection & Redaction

Data Extraction
	•	Invoke Textract:
	•	After classification, send the document to Textract’s AnalyzeDocument API (with FORMS and TABLES features) to extract text and structured data.
	•	Retrieve bounding box coordinates for key elements.

Redaction Process
	•	Redaction Logic:
	•	Identify PII or sensitive data either by using Textract results or by applying custom rules/Comprehend’s PII detection.
	•	Use the bounding boxes to overlay redactions on the original document (e.g., using a client-side canvas library in Next.js or a server-side image processing library).
	•	User Feedback on Redaction:
	•	Allow users to manually adjust or confirm bounding boxes on a redacted preview.
	•	Store these corrections as annotations for improving detection accuracy in future iterations.

4. Integration & Workflow Orchestration

Backend Workflow
	•	Lambda & Step Functions:
	•	Use Lambda functions to handle API calls to Textract and Comprehend.
	•	Orchestrate the entire process (upload → classification → Textract extraction → redaction) using AWS Step Functions, ensuring error handling and retry mechanisms.
	•	S3 & Environment Variables:
	•	Leverage your existing S3 configuration (from your .env.local file) for storage and retrieval.
	•	Secure access and update environment variables as needed for new AWS services.

Frontend Enhancements (Next.js)
	•	Document Upload Interface:
	•	Build or extend your current upload component to support both automatic and manual classification modes.
	•	Display real-time progress/status updates (e.g., “Classifying…”, “Processing redaction…”).
	•	Feedback Collection:
	•	Create UI components that allow users to select the correct document type when needed.
	•	Provide an interactive redaction editor for adjusting bounding boxes.
	•	Data Visualization & Logs:
	•	Optionally display metrics (e.g., classification confidence, manual intervention rates) using dashboards powered by CloudWatch or custom analytics.

5. Security, Scalability & Monitoring
	•	Security:
	•	Ensure all data in transit uses HTTPS.
	•	Encrypt documents at rest (S3 with KMS).
	•	Use strict IAM roles to limit access to AWS resources.
	•	Scalability:
	•	Use serverless components (Lambda, DynamoDB) to scale with demand.
	•	Process large files asynchronously (via SQS/SNS triggers if needed).
	•	Monitoring & Logging:
	•	Monitor AWS service performance (Textract, Comprehend) with CloudWatch.
	•	Set up alerts for low confidence or high manual corrections, so you can fine-tune retraining frequency.
